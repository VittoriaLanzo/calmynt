# Privacy Policy (GDPR‑aligned)

**Effective date:** February 15, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Focus Blocks (the “App”) handles personal data.

## 1. Who is the controller?
**Controller:** Vittoria Lanzo (the “Controller”).

If you publish the App, you should add a contact email here.

## 2. What data we process
The App runs locally in your browser. It stores the following data in your browser’s LocalStorage:
- Study blocks you create (title, date, start time, duration, type, completion status)
- Optional images attached to blocks (stored locally in your browser)
- User preferences (Simple/Calm mode settings)

The App does **not** send data to any server. There are no accounts, analytics, cookies, or third‑party tracking.

## 3. Legal basis (GDPR)
**Article 6(1)(b) – Contract/Service:** Processing is necessary to provide the App’s features.

## 4. Data sharing
No personal data is shared with third parties. The App is local‑first and offline by default.

## 5. Data retention
Data remains in your browser until you delete it or clear your browser storage. You can also export data at any time.

## 6. International transfers
No data is transferred internationally because data stays in your browser.

## 7. Your rights (GDPR)
You have the right to access, correct, delete, or export your data at any time. Because all data is stored locally in your browser, you can do this directly by:
- Editing or deleting blocks in the App
- Exporting your data as JSON
- Clearing your browser’s LocalStorage for this site

## 8. Children’s privacy
The App is not specifically targeted to children under 13. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has used the App, you can clear local data in the browser.

## 9. Changes to this policy
If the App is updated to include server‑side features, this policy will be updated accordingly.

## 10. Contact
If you publish the App, add a contact email here.
