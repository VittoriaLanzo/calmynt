# Privacy Policy — Calmynt

**Effective date:** February 16, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Calmynt (the “App”) handles personal data. It is written to meet the GDPR transparency requirements for data collected directly from users.

## 1. Controller and contact
**Controller:** Vittoria Lanzo
**Contact:** vittoria3103@gmail.com

No data protection officer (DPO) has been appointed.

## 2. What data is processed
The App runs locally in your browser and stores data in your browser’s LocalStorage:
- Tasks and events you create (title, date, time, duration, tags, completion status, notes)
- Optional images attached to blocks (stored locally)
- Preferences (e.g., buffer minutes, visual density, mode)

The App does **not** send this data to any server. There are no accounts, analytics, cookies, or third‑party tracking.

If you contact us by email, we will process your email address and message to respond.

## 3. Purposes and legal basis
We process data for these purposes:
- **Provide the App’s features locally** (e.g., scheduling, saving tasks) — **GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)** (performance of a contract/service).
- **Respond to support requests** (if you email us) — **GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)** (legitimate interests in responding).

## 4. Recipients
We do not share your App data with any third parties. Your App data stays on your device.

## 5. International transfers
No international transfers occur because App data is stored locally in your browser.

## 6. Retention
App data remains in your browser until you delete it or clear browser storage. Email communications (if any) are kept only as long as needed to respond and handle follow‑ups.

## 7. Your GDPR rights
You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object to processing, and receive a portable copy of your personal data.

Because App data is stored locally, you can exercise these rights by:
- Editing or deleting tasks/blocks in the App
- Exporting your data as JSON
- Clearing your browser’s LocalStorage for this site

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

## 8. Whether data is required
Providing data is optional. If you choose not to add data, some features (like scheduling or reminders) will not work.

## 9. Automated decision-making
We do not use automated decision‑making or profiling within the meaning of GDPR Article 22.

## 10. Children’s privacy
The App is not directed to children. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has used the App, you can clear local data in the browser.

## 11. Changes to this policy
If we add server‑side features or third‑party services, we will update this policy.
