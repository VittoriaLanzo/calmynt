# Privacy Policy — Calmynt

**Effective date:** February 16, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Calmynt (the "App") handles personal data. It is written to meet the GDPR transparency requirements for data collected directly from users.

## 1. Controller and contact
**Controller:** Vittoria Lanzo
**Contact:** vittoria3103@gmail.com

No data protection officer (DPO) has been appointed.

## 2. What data is processed
The App runs locally in your browser and stores data in your browser's LocalStorage:
- Tasks and events you create (title, date, time, duration, tags, completion status, notes)
- Optional images attached to blocks (stored locally)
- Preferences (e.g., buffer minutes, visual density, mode)

**Feedback data:** If you submit feedback through the App's feedback form, the following data is sent to external services:
- Feedback title, description, and category

The App does **not** send any other data to any server. There are no accounts, analytics, cookies, or third‑party tracking.

If you contact us by email, we will process your email address and message to respond.

## 3. Purposes and legal basis
We process data for these purposes:
- **Provide the App's features locally** (e.g., scheduling, saving tasks) — **GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)** (performance of a contract/service).
- **Process user feedback** (create issue reports to improve the App) — **GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)** (legitimate interests in improving the service).
- **Respond to support requests** (if you email us) — **GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)** (legitimate interests in responding).

## 4. Recipients
Your App data stays on your device, except when you submit feedback. In that case, feedback data is shared with:
- **Relay.app** (workflow automation service) — to process and route feedback
- **GitHub** (issue tracking) — to create issue reports on our repository

## 5. International transfers
App data is stored locally in your browser. Feedback data submitted through the feedback form may be transferred to servers operated by Relay.app and GitHub, which may be located outside the EEA. Both services provide adequate safeguards under GDPR.

## 6. Retention
App data remains in your browser until you delete it or clear browser storage. Feedback submitted as GitHub issues is retained on GitHub until manually deleted. Email communications (if any) are kept only as long as needed to respond and handle follow‑ups.

## 7. Your GDPR rights
You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object to processing, and receive a portable copy of your personal data.

Because App data is stored locally, you can exercise these rights by:
- Editing or deleting tasks/blocks in the App
- Exporting your data as JSON
- Clearing your browser's LocalStorage for this site

For feedback data stored on GitHub, contact us at the email above to request deletion.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

## 8. Whether data is required
Providing data is optional. If you choose not to add data, some features (like scheduling or reminders) will not work. Submitting feedback is entirely optional.

## 9. Automated decision-making
We do not use automated decision‑making or profiling within the meaning of GDPR Article 22.

## 10. Children's privacy
The App is not directed to children. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has used the App, you can clear local data in the browser.

## 11. Changes to this policy
If we add server‑side features or third‑party services, we will update this policy.
